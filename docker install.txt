Docker requires Hyper-V:  
  
Windows 10 Home does not have Hyper-V where Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Server version has!  
Hyper-V is a feature that allows Linux VM to work on Windows.  
Docker Container needs Hyper-V to work properly...   

Then how to install docker on windows 10 home:  
  
Check windows 10 Home requirements to install docker.  
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/  
Windows version should be higher than 2004, to check press win+R, mostly it will be latest version, so no problem.  

ENABLE VIRTUALIZATION 
I FOLLOWED THIS LINK - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuTxfzCvMY
you can check in task manager, then performance..  

Then I installed docker from docker hub..

While installing docker desktop:  
There will be two configurations it will ask - Enable WSL2 Windows Features, Add shortcut to desktop, check these two boxes.  
WSL2 lets us to use Docker Desktop on windows.  
RESTART ONCE INSTALLATION COMPLETED.  

It may give popup and say - WSL2 installation is incomplete.  
The WSL 2 Linux Kernel is now installed using a separate MSI update package.  
Please click the link and follow the instructions to install the kernel update.

download latest wsl..  
Restart windows and restart docker..  


Windows 10 Enterprise:  
While installing docker desktop, it wil ask three - Enable Hyper-V Windows Features, Install required Windows components for WSL2, add shortcut to desktop, check all 3  
RESTART..  

It may give popup and say - WSL2 installation is incomplete.  
The WSL 2 Linux Kernel is now installed using a separate MSI update package.  
Please click the link and follow the instructions to install the kernel update.

Restart windows and restart docker..  

there are two parts while developing using docker on windows. 
1. where you use wsl to do your development - this is similar to how you would work on an ubuntu environment. not a lot of difference. all you will have 
to do is understand how wsl works. i would recommend to use wsl2 which will enable easy installation of docker as well without the requirement of windows pro 
or hyper-virtualization. on windows home, there is no hyper-v and if you don't have wsl2 you won't be able to install docker desktop at all. 

2. when you use git bash or command prompt or powershell - things get a bit complicated here. when you install docker, 
you will have to select a wsl2 engine. this way you don't have to worry about accessing from wsl. 
you can directly access docker from any of the command line which windows gives by default. 
the problem would appear when you try to mount. so here you would need to understand how git bash works and understand it's 
path notations to mount volumes from command prompt/powershell.
